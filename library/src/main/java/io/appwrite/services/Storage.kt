     * resource using either a [server
     * integration](/docs/server/database#storageCreateBucket) API or directly
     * from your Appwrite console.
     *
     * Larger files should be uploaded using multiple requests with the
     * [content-range](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Range)
     * header to send a partial request with a maximum supported chunk of `5MB`.
     * The `content-range` header values should always be in bytes.
     *
     * When the first request is sent, the server will return the **File** object,
     * and the subsequent part request must include the file's **id** in
     * `x-appwrite-id` header to allow the server to know that the partial upload
     * is for the existing file and not for a new one.
     *
     * If you're creating a new file using one of the Appwrite SDKs, all the
     * chunking logic will be managed by the SDK internally.
     *
     *
     * @param bucketId Storage bucket unique ID. You can create a new storage bucket using the Storage service [server integration](/docs/server/storage#createBucket).
     * @param fileId File ID. Choose your own unique ID or pass the string &quot;unique()&quot; to auto generate it. Valid chars are a-z, A-Z, 0-9, period, hyphen, and underscore. Can&#039;t start with a special char. Max length is 36 chars.
     * @param file Binary file.
     * @param read An array of strings with read permissions. By default only the current user is granted with read permissions. [learn more about permissions](https://appwrite.io/docs/permissions) and get a full list of available permissions.
     * @param write An array of strings with write permissions. By default only the current user is granted with write permissions. [learn more about permissions](https://appwrite.io/docs/permissions) and get a full list of available permissions.
